Backpack
========

##Requisites
Backpack works with [ES6 generators](http://flippinawesome.org/2014/02/10/replacing-callbacks-with-es6-generators/) and [Node.js v0.11.13](http://blog.nodejs.org/2014/05/02/node-v0-11-13-unstable/). This means that the project it's unstable by the moment.

You can easily install Node.js v0.11.13 (this version is the one that supports ES6 generators) with [n, the node version manager](https://github.com/visionmedia/n) built by Visionmedia.

##Installation
Install Node.js modules running:

```
$ npm install
```

##Usage
To run the project use the following command, the ```-harmony``` flag will enable most of the ES6 experimental features.

```
$ node -harmony src/main.js
```
